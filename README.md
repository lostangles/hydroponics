Hydroponics controller for ebb and flow type system

Based on Billie's work on Billie's hydroponics controller @:

https://github.com/BillieBricks/Billie-s-Hydroponic-Controller/blob/master/HydroponicControllerV1.1.0

Added features:  
Water pump control for ebb/flow system
ESP8266 support for remote sensor readings via EasyIOT
Thermistor algorithm for water temperature
Watchdog support for error and crash handling

Controller allows automated pH control, controls flooding/draining of the grow bed,
and reports all stats back through an ESP8266 using EasyIoT.
